    <h1>Sans Serif Fonts</h1>
    <p id = "introductionP">In typography and lettering, a sans-serif, sans serif, gothic, or simply sans letterform is one that does not have extending features called "serifs" at the end of strokes.
        Sans-serif fonts tend to have less stroke width variation than serif fonts.
        They are often used to convey simplicity and modernity or minimalism.</p>
