                        <p>Garamond is a group of many serif typefaces, named for sixteenth-century Parisian engraver Claude Garamond,
                            generally spelled as Garamont in his lifetime.
                            Garamond-style typefaces are popular and particularly often used for book printing and body text. </p>
